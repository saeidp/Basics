# Given an integer array, output all the unique pairs that sum up to a specific value k.
# So the input:
# pair_sum([1,3,2,2],4)
# would return 2 pairs:
#  (1,3)
#  (2,2)

# The O(N) algorithm uses the set data structure. We perform a linear pass from the
# beginning and for each element we check whether k-element is in the set of seen
# numbers. If it is, then we found a pair of sum k and add it to the output. 
# If not, this element doesnâ€™t belong to a pair yet, and we add it to the set of seen elements.
# The algorithm is really simple once we figure out using a set. 
# The complexity is O(N) because we do a single linear scan of the array, 
# and for each element we just check whether the corresponding number to form a pair is in
# the set or add the current element to the set. 
# Insert and find operations of a set are both average O(1), so the algorithm is O(N) in total.
