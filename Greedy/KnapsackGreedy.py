# Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W
# to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. In other words, given two integer
# arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent values and weights associated
# with n items respectively. Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity,
# find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset
# is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item,
# or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).
