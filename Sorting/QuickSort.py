#//O(nlogn)
# Recursive solution has O(logn) memory complexity as
# it will consume memory on the stack.
# Here is an overview of how the quicksort algorithm
# works. Select a pivot element from the array.
# We can pick the first element as the pivot (following
# Hoare's algorithm). Another common approach is to select
# a random element as the pivot.
# Reorder the array by comparing with the pivot element
# such that smaller values end up at the left side, and
# the larger values end up at the right side of the pivot.
# Now, the pivot element is in its correct sorted position.
# Applying the above steps,Â we can recursively sort the
# sublists on the right and left sides of the pivot.
